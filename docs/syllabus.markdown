## Grading Criteria

Projects will be graded on a scale of 1-5 on the following criteria:

- demonstration of understanding in node based programming (1 pt)
- efficient use of graphics pipelines and program optimization (0.5 pt)
- engagement with the prompts and readings (0.5 pt)
- creativity, purpose of vision and aesthetic execution (1 pt)
- personal evaluation of your own work (1 pt)

### Course Grades

Your grade in the course will be a weighted average of your project grades:
- weights greater than 1 may be applied to projects that show exemplary growth 
- weights less than 1 may be applied to anomalously low scores

## Notes on the Course Approach and Flow

The course will be almost entirely spent working in TouchDesigner itself. Sessions will be spent covering topics by making "networks" and discovering by doing, with the exceptions of the presentation dates listed above.  

Presentations are meant to enrich the course experience by allowing all participants to witness each others interpretations and methods and provide a space for feedback and critique.  

The required readings should have a significant impact on the course which is detailed below.

*Note: with the exception of the final project presentation material will need to be developed mostly outside of class sessions.*

## Required Readings

There are weekly required readings for the course that are meant to operate *in tandem* to the course and do not have any technical bearing for TouchDesigner itself. The readings cover some conceptual tools and taxonomies for reasoning about movement, thought, images and "working with light" -- topics fundamental to motion graphics or moving images of any type. You should plan to spend 30 minutes to 2 hours a week on the readings. (PDF is available online, in D2L and on the course Social Reading site)

### Course Text

- *Using Deleuze: The Cinema Books, Film Studies and Effect* by Dyrk Ashton

### Additional Remarks About Selection of the Text    

Deleuze's Cinema books are commonly used in Film Studies programs at the both the undergraduate and graduate level. However, the original sources can be obtuse, and as per the author's style, they are rarely concise. Out of the many secondary sources evaluated, I found this thesis by Dyrk Ashton to be the least pretentious and most fun.  

*Here is a picture of Dyrk*

### Social Reading Option 

A non-mandatory and experimental website is available to read/write real-time comments on the course texts shared with the whole class in a web browser. This is self-hosted and there are no guarantees on functionality or security.

## Attendance Policy

Attendance to sessions is vital to success in the course. If you have difficulties attending sessions, notes or recordings may be available depending on presence of support staff. Reasonable effort will be made to support "asynchronicities"

## Make-Ups / Late Work

Presentations are only accepted during presentation sessions. Please submit any late work directly to D2L (or email). Material review can be scheduled during office hours (if available).

## Flexibility 
The instructor reserves the right to modify course
content and/or substitute assignments and learning activities in
response to institutional, weather, or class situations.
